If you're anything like me, you might be harbouring different images of who you think you are and who you think you should be. And quite often, you try to "behave" according to these made-up images in your head. Each time you choose a specific "mask" to wear, whole other parts of you go to die.

To exemplify, suppose say you think of yourself as a young smart entrepreneur who dreams of one day changing the world. Surely, you will consciously or sub-consciously behave in a way that tells everyone, "Look! I fit that role perfectly".

That's a limited version of you.

Do it long enough, you'll find yourself stuck in this one-dimensional, narrow, and unchanging personality that screams for freedom to just be. It piles on stress, anxiety, and depression as a serious side-effect. It brings upon random health issues without warning. Then you go try "meditation" and "mindfulness" apps to try and figure out what's really happening.

The answer is simple. Your "you" is tired of being "him".

So do yourself a favor and do things outside of your goals and your comfort zone regularly and as often as you can. Take a dance class, try skate-boarding, shoot a movie, go hiking, climb a mountain. There's more to you than just playing a part and running a show.

That's an un-limited version of you.

Be un-limited.
